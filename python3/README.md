## Performance Tips
1. Write your solution inside a function. Lookup variables in the global scope is more expensive, than using variables in the local scope.
2. **Avoid for loops like the plague**. Favor Python built ins. Always use map, filter, concatenate strings with join, etc.
3. **Writing output is really expensive**. Writing a gigantic string once, may be better than writing several small strings.
4. Type casting is really expensive. Avoid if possible (string to int).
5. [Careful with Dict vs Lists for graphs](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/21048)
6. Use PyPy2âœ… / PyPy3
7. List comprehension is faster than for loops
8.
